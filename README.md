- This project simulates a help desk request where a user (or an application) on an Azure VM needs specific network access (e.g., to run a simple web server or connect to a service), and you, as the help desk, need to configure the VM's firewall to allow this. You'll then test the access and demonstrate how to troubleshoot if it fails due to firewall rules.
