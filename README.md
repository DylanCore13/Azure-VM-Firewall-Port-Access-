<h2> Objective </h2>


 This project simulates a help desk request where a user (or an application) on an Azure VM needs specific network access (e.g., to run a simple web server or connect to a service), and you, as the help desk, need to configure the VM's firewall to allow this. You'll then test the access and demonstrate how to troubleshoot if it fails due to firewall rules.






Networking Fundamentals: Shows understanding of basic firewall concepts and port numbers.
Common Request: Users frequently need specific ports opened for applications.
Troubleshooting: Demonstrates diagnosing network connectivity issues.
Azure VM Networking: Practical experience with Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs).
Cost-Effective: Uses a small Azure VM and minimal other services.
Azure Services Used:

Azure Virtual Machine (VM): A Windows VM to simulate a user's machine.
Azure Network Security Group (NSG): The Azure-level firewall for the VM.
Azure Resource Groups: For organization.
